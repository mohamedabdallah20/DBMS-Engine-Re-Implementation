# Query optimizer
**Query optimizer** is a feature of many relational database management systems and other databases such as NoSQL. The **query optimizer** attempts to determine the most efficient way to execute a given query by considering the possible [query plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_plan "Query plan"). 
# Query Hints 
A **Query Hints** is a is an addition to the SQL standard that instructs the database engine on how to execute the query. For example, a hint may tell the engine to use or not to use an index (even if the [query optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_optimizer "Query optimizer") would decide otherwise).

# Query plan
**query plan** is the sequence of steps used to access Data in a SQL relational database system.

# Write-A head-Log (WAL)
A write ahead log is an append-only auxiliary disk-resident structure used for crash and transaction recovery. The changes are first recorded in the log, which must be written to [stable storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_storage "Stable storage"), before the changes are written to the database.
